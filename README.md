# Duolingo-in-Discord-Bot
A discord bot, just like Duolingo, but in Discord. Very simple, but you can get your chinese, russian, spanish or french lessons in without leaving Discord! It's very poorly written but if you are interested, you find the whole source code here.

To test it, you can just easily join my Discord Server: https://discord.gg/mnc2ShKEqT

**How to use?**
1. Join my Discord or create your own, with the bot inside and go to an according channel(like chinese_a1)
2.  Write 'start' to initialize the bot. It will give you a sentence in your selected language and level.
3.  Write the answer in the chat.
4.  IF you don't know, you can write 'solution' to get the solution

Note:
Your answer may be marked as false even though it isn't, the bot just has one specific answer that is allowed.
If you create your own server, the channels have to be named exactly the same as they are in my server, otherwise you could just edit this in the code.
